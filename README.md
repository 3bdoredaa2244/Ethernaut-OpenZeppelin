## Background

Ethernaut, created by OpenZeppelin, is a series of Web3-based security puzzles for Ethereum. Each level presents a vulnerable smart contract that users must exploit to gain access or complete an objective. These challenges cover essential concepts in Ethereum security and serve as an effective hands-on learning experience for smart contract developers.

## Challenges

This repository contains solutions for various Ethernaut levels, including:

- **Level 1: Fallback** - Manipulate contract ownership through fallback functions.
- **Level 2: Fallout** - Exploit incorrect constructor naming to gain ownership.
- **Level 3: Coin Flip** - Leverage pseudorandomness to predict outcomes and win.
- **Level 4: Telephone** - Exploit contract calls to bypass restricted functions.
- **Level 5: Token** - Overflow token balances to obtain more tokens.
- **Level 6: Delegation** - Use delegatecall to gain unauthorized access.
- ... and more.

Each level solution includes:
- **Explanation of Vulnerability**: Understanding the underlying issue.
- **Solution Code**: Code to exploit or secure the vulnerability.
- **Walkthrough**: Step-by-step process on how the exploit works.

## Installation

To run the solutions locally, youâ€™ll need:
- **Node.js**: ^14.x or later
- **Hardhat or Foundry**: Solidity development environment
